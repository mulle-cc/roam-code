# CI pipeline for roam-code itself.
#
# Jobs:
#   test         — pytest across all supported Python versions (3.9–3.13)
#   lint         — ruff format/lint check (Python 3.12 only, fast gate)
#   self-analysis — roam analyses its own codebase on PRs using the local
#                   composite action (uses: ./), posting a sticky comment
#                   and uploading SARIF to GitHub Code Scanning.
#
# For the example template that downstream users copy into their repos,
# see .github/workflows/roam.yml (dormant, workflow_dispatch only).

  # -- Test suite across all supported Python versions -----------------------
  # Ubuntu-only: roam-code is pure Python with no compiled extensions; a
  # single-OS matrix covers correctness without the 3x cost of a full matrix.
  # Use -m "not slow" to skip timing-sensitive performance tests that are
  # prone to flaking under CI resource constraints.
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:

  # -- Self-analysis: roam eats its own dog food on PRs ----------------------
  # Runs the local composite action (uses: ./) to analyse this repo on every
  # pull request. Posts a sticky PR comment with health score and pr-risk,
  # uploads SARIF findings to GitHub Code Scanning, and enforces a soft
  # health gate (>=50) so the job fails loudly if quality degrades.
