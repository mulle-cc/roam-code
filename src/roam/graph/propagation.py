"""Context propagation through call graph for improved context ranking.

Implements bottom-up propagation: given seed nodes in a directed call graph,
BFS outward through callee edges (downstream) and caller edges (upstream) with
exponentially decaying weights.  Results are merged with existing PageRank
scores to produce a blended context ranking.

    """BFS from *seed_nodes* through the call graph, scoring reached nodes.

    Callee edges (outgoing / downstream) are traversed with weight
    ``decay ** depth``.  Caller edges (incoming / upstream) are traversed with
    weight ``(decay * 0.5) ** depth`` — upstream context matters but is
    secondary to the transitive dependency chain.

    Handles cycles via a visited set: a node's score is only improved if we
    reach it via a *shorter* path; once a node is settled at the shortest
    callee distance it is not re-expanded through callee edges, and similarly
    for caller edges.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G:
        A ``networkx.DiGraph`` where edges go from caller to callee
        (i.e. ``A -> B`` means A calls B).
    seed_nodes:
        Iterable of node IDs that are the query targets (score = 1.0).
    max_depth:
        Maximum BFS depth (inclusive).  Nodes at depth > max_depth are not
        added.  Defaults to 3.
    decay:
        Per-level decay factor for callee direction.  Caller direction uses
        ``decay * 0.5``.  Defaults to 0.5.

    Returns
    -------
    dict[int, float]
        Mapping of ``{node_id: propagation_score}``.  Seed nodes have score
        1.0; unreachable nodes are absent.
